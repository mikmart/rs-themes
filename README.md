# rs-themes

RStudio version 1.2 and up added support for user customizable themes. The purpose of this repo is to collect some themes that I use for easy access across different devices.

## Using the themes

Accompanying the feature, [this blog post](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-blog/rstudio-ide-custom-theme-support) explains how to create, install and uninstall the RStudio IDE themes. Mentioned in the post (and again here for convenience), themes created with [this tmThemes editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) can be used directly with RStudio.
